# AIDD-30-Day-Challenge-Task-7SPECKit Plus
SPECKIT PLUS: It is a systematic framework developed by Sir Zia's team that enhances the original Spec Kit tool. It provides a structured, step-by-step approach to building projects by breaking down the development process into clear, manageable phases.

5 Core Concepts of SPECKIT Plus:
1. CONSTITUTION: ✔
In according to my opinion Always start by understanding WHY you're building something. Know the problem you're solving and who you're helping before writing any code.
2. SPECIFY:    ✔
In this Phase Break big projects into small, easy pieces. Don't try to do everything at once. Make a simple roadmap of what comes first, second, and last.
3. PLAN:  ✔
This planning phase transform Complete one task at a time. Finish one small part, then move to the next. This makes hard projects feel easy and keeps you from getting overwhelmed.
4. TASK: ✔
 This is the execution phase in which they Write down exactly what you want to build. Be specific about features, rules, and requirements so there's no confusion later.
5. IMPLEMENT: ✔
The final Phase involves implementation Actually create your project by writing code, testing if it works, fixing mistakes, and making sure everything runs smoothly before calling it done.
