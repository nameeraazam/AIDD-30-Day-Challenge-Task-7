# AIDD-30-Day-Challenge-Task-7SPECKit Plus
SPECKIT PLUS: is a systematic framework developed by Sir Zia's team that enhances the original Spec Kit tool. It provides a structured, step-by-step approach to building projects by breaking down the development process into clear, manageable phases.

5 Core Concepts of SPECKIT Plus:
1. CONSTITUTION:
Always start by understanding WHY you're building something. Know the problem you're solving and who you're helping before writing any code.
2. SPECIFY:
Break big projects into small, easy pieces. Don't try to do everything at once. Make a simple roadmap of what comes first, second, and last.
3. PLAN:
Complete one task at a time. Finish one small part, then move to the next. This makes hard projects feel easy and keeps you from getting overwhelmed.
4. TASK:
Write down exactly what you want to build. Be specific about features, rules, and requirements so there's no confusion later.
5. IMPLEMENT:
Actually create your project by writing code, testing if it works, fixing mistakes, and making sure everything runs smoothly before calling it done.
